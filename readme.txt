	sqrt -> gives square root of given number
	pow -> gives value of a number raised to power of second
	fact -> gives value of the factorial of the given number
	exp ->  gives the exponential value of number
	log-> gives the natural logarithm of x to the base e
	log10 -> gives the logarithmic value of x to the base 10
	sin -> gives value of sine of the angle in radians
	cos -> gives value of cosine of the angle in radians	
	tan -> gives value of tangent of the angle in radians
	sinh -> gives value of hyperbolic sine of x
	cosh -> gives value of hyperbolic cosine of x
